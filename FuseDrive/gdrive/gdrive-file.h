/*
 * gdrive_file_open():  Opens a specified Google Drive file and returns a handle
 *                      that can be used for file operations.
 * Parameters:
 *      fileId (const char*):
 *              The Google Drive file ID of the file to open. This must be the
 *              ID of a non-folder file.
 *      flags (int):
 *              File access flags. See standard documentation for open(2). The
 *              same flags must be passed to gdrive_file_close() when closing
 *              the file.
 *      pError (int*):
 *              A pointer to a memory location that will hold the specific error
 *              value if an error occurs. The pointed-to value does not change
 *              if the function succeeds.
 * Return value (Gdrive_File*):
 *      A file handle that can be used for operations such as reading the file's
 *      contents, or NULL on error. This handle must be passed to 
 *      gdrive_file_close() when the file is no longer needed.
 * NOTE:
 *      This function can be called multiple times for the same file, as long
 *      as each call is eventually balanced by a call to gdrive_file_close()
 *      with the returned file handle and the same flags.

/*
 * gdrive_file_close(): Closes an open file, releasing any unnecessary

 * Parameters:
 *      pFile (Gdrive_File*):
 *              A file handle returned by a prior call to gdrive_file_open().
 *      flags (int):

/*
 * gdrive_file_read():  Reads the contents of an open file and adds the contents

 * Parameters:
 *      pFile (Gdrive_File*):
 *              A file handle returned by a prior call to gdrive_file_open().
 *      buf (char*):
 *              The location of a memory buffer into which to read the data. The
 *              buffer must already be allocated with at least size bytes. It is
 *              safe to pass a NULL pointer.
 *      size (size_t):
 *              The number of bytes to read.
 *      offset (off_t):
 *              The offset (zero-based, in bytes) from the start of the file at 
 *              which to start reading. 
 * Return value (int):
 *      On success, the actual number of bytes read (which may be less than the
 *      size argument if the end of the file was reached). On error, returns
 *      -1 times an error that could be returned from ferror(3).
 * TODO:
 *      Change the return type to size_t, and add a parameter to hold a pointer
 *      to an error value.

 *      buf (char*):

 *              A file handle returned by a prior call to gdrive_file_open().
 * Return value (unsigned int):
 *      An integer value from 0 to 7 representing Unix filesystem permissions
 *      for the file. A permission needs to be present in both the Google Drive
 *      user's roles for the particular file and the overall access mode for the
