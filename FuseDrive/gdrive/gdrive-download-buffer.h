 * gdrive_dlbuf_create():   Creates a new Gdrive_Download_Buffer struct. Once 
 *                          this struct is no longer needed, the caller should
 *                          call gdrive_dlbuf_free().
 * Parameters:
 *      initialSize (size_t):
 *              The in-memory buffer will be initially allocated with a size
 *              of initialSize bytes. The buffer will grow dynamically as needed
 *              so this is not a limitation on the size of downloaded data. If
 *              a file handle is given in the fh parameter, then initialSize is
 *              recommended to be 0.
 *      fh (FILE*):
 *              If fh is NULL, the downloaded data will be stored in an 
 *              in-memory buffer. Otherwise, it will be written to the stream
 *              specified by this parameter.
 * Return value (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *      NULL on error, or a pointer to a newly allocated Gdrive_Download_Buffer
 *      struct on success.

 *                      stream, does NOT close the stream.
 * Parameters:
 *      pBuf (Gdrive_Download_Buffer*):
 *              A pointer to the struct to be freed. This pointer should no 
 *              longer be used after the function returns.

 * Return value (long):
