 *      size (size_t):

 *              Any user-defined state or other information that may be needed

 * Notes:
 *      For more information on when and how this callback function will be

/*
 * gdrive_xfer_create():    Creates a new empty Gdrive_Transfer struct. Various
 *                          funtions in this header file should be used to add
 *                          options to the returned struct, and then the

 *                          gdrive_xfer_execute().
 * Return value (Gdrive_Transfer*):
 *      On success, a pointer to a Gdrive_Transfer struct that can be used to
 *      describe and perform a download or upload. On failure, NULL. When no
 *      longer needed, the returned pointer should be passed to 
 *      gdrive_xfer_free().
 * Note:
