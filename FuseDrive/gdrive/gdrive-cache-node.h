/*
 * gdrive_cnode_get():  Finds the cache node with the given fileId, optionally
 *                      creating it if it doesn't exist. (This is listed as a
 *                      constructor because it's the only public way to create
 *                      a new Gdrive_Cache_Node struct).
 * Parameters:
 *      pParent (Gdrive_Cache_Node*):
 *              Reserved for internal use. Must be NULL.
 *      ppNode (Gdrive_Cache_Node**):
 *              The address of a pointer to the root node. If the requested
 *              cache node doesn't already exist and addIfDoesntExist is true,
 *              this pointer may be changed.
 *      fileId (const char*):
 *              The Google Drive file ID to search for.
 *      addIfDoesntExist (bool):
 *              If a cache node doesn't already exist for the requested file ID,
 *              create a new one if and only if this argument is true.
 *      pAlreadyExists (bool*):
 *              Can be NULL. The address of a bool used to indicate whether the
 *              requested node had to be created or already existed. If 
 *              addIfDoesntExist is true, then the bool value at this memory
 *              location will become true if a new node was not created, and 
 *              false if a new node was created. If addIfDoesntExist is false,
 *              then the value stored here is undefined after this function 
 *              exits.
 * Return value (Gdrive_Cache_Node):
 *      On success, returns a pointer to a Gdrive_Cache_Node for the given
 *      Google Drive file ID. On failure, or if the given file ID doesn't 
 *      already have a cache node and addIfDoesntExist is false, returns NULL.
