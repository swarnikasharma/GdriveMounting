/*
 * gdrive_init():   Initializes the network connection, sets appropriate 
 *                  settings for the Google Drive session, and ensures the user 
 *                  has granted necessary access permissions for the Google 
 *                  Drive account.  This function MUST be called  EXACTLY ONCE, 
 *                  at the start of the program, prior to any other gdrive_*() 
 *                  calls.  If multi-threaded mode is ever supported (not 
 *                  currently planned), this function must be called BEFORE any 
 *                  extra threads are created.
 *                  Note if using the curl library elsewhere: This function 
 *                  calls curl_global_init().
 * Parameters:
 *      access (int):
 *              One or more GDRIVE_ACCESS_* values (as defined in gdrive.h) 
 *              combined with bitwise OR.
 *      authFileName (char*):
 *              Optional filename for an authorization token file, or NULL
 *              to leave unspecified.  Does not need to be an existing file.  
 *              Existing auth token and refresh token will be read from this 
 *              file if it exists.  Any updated tokens will be written to the
 *              file.
 *      interactionMode (enum Gdrive_Interaction):   
 *              If the user has not already granted the requested permissions
 *              or has revoked permission, determines whether we can guide the 
 *              user through the authorization flow.  If not, treat insufficient
 *              permissions as an error.  Possible values are:
 *                  GDRIVE_INTERACTION_NEVER: No interaction with the user.  
 *                      Must have a previously saved access token and refresh 
 *                      token to avoid an error.
 *                  GDRIVE_INTERACTION_STARTUP: Prompt the user for 
 *                      authentication, if needed, during the gdrive_init() 
 *                      call only.  If permission is later revoked, do not
 *                      prompt at that point.
 *                  GDRIVE_INTERACTION_ALWAYS: Prompt the user for 
 *                      authentication any time it is needed.
 * Returns: 0 on success, other value on error.
