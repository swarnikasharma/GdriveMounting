/*
 * gdrive_fcontents_add():  Creates a new Gdrive_File_Contents struct and any

 *                          structs.
 * Parameters:
 *      pHead (Gdrive_File_Contents*):
 *              If non-NULL, a pointer to the head of an existing list to which
 *              to add the newly created struct.
 * Return value (Gdrive_File_Contents*):
 *      A pointer to the newly created struct. IF AND ONLY IF pHead was NULL,
 *      the caller is responsible for passing the address of this pointer (or 
 *      of a copy of the pointer) to any subsequent gdrive_fcontents_delete()
 *      calls, and also for passing the address of this pointer (or of a copy)
