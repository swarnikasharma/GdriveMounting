 * A struct and related functions for managing cached data. There are two 
 * in-memory caches. One is a mapping from file pathnames to Google Drive 
 * file IDs, and the other holds basic file information such as size and 
 * access time (along with information about any open files and their on-disk
 * cached contents).
 * 
 * This header is used internally by Gdrive code and should not be included 
 * outside of Gdrive code.

 *                              free them if desired.
 * Parameters:
 *      path (const char*):
 *              The full pathname of a file or folder on Google Drive, expressed

 *              root folder, would be specified as "/FolderA/FileX". NOTE: The

 *              ID. If the path argument is identical (based on string 
 *              comparison) to a path already in the file ID cache, the existing
 *              item will be updated, replacing the existing file ID with a copy
 *              of the fileId argument.
 *      fileId (const char*):
 *              The Google Drive file ID of the specified file. Because Google
 *              Drive allows a single file (with a single file ID) to have
 *              multiple parents (each resulting in a different path), fileId
 *              does not need to be unique. The same file ID can correspond to

 *      addIfDoesntExist (bool):

 *              addIfDoesntExist was false.
 * Return value (Gdrive_Cache_Node*):
 *      If the file ID given by the fileId parameter already exists in the 
 *      cache, returns a pointer to the cache node describing the specified 
 *      file. If the file ID is not in the cache, then returns a pointer to a
